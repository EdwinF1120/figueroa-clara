<!--
Mr. Stamp here,

A couple things for you to fix:
1) the links from your homepage are broken. In your index.html file, the urls in your a tags have your name capitalized. They should be exactly as they are on your github: lowercase and with a dash between your two names.
the link to the recipe one, for example, should be like so "/figueroa-clara/wdsub/recipe.html" Please fix the links on your homepage.
2) The very first element in your body on this page should be an h1 heading with a title about brownies. Please add that heading before the lists start.
3) This page should contain nested lists (lists within lists). You just have one list that opens and closes, then another list that opens and closes, then another,...
Instead, around all of your lists should be another ordered lists that contains them all. So put an opening <ol> tag before your first <ol> and a closing </ol> tag after your last </ol>.
Then, around each inner list, place a set of li tags.
4) Finally, change the list-style-type property of the inner lists to be lower-alpha.
