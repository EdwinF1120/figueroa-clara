<!--
  Hi Edwin, this was a pretty good first webpage submission. The only issue is that the link from your homepage is broken.
  You'll want to update the url in that link to "/figueroa-clara/wdsub/week1.html" instead of "FIGUEROA/wdsub/week1.html"
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
 <head>
  <title>Week 1 Submission</title>
 <head> 
<body>
  <!-- Don't screw this up --> 
    <p>Page content for website</p>
    <!--<p>still nothing to see here</p>-->
    <h1>Week 1 Submission</h1>
    <h2>html</h2>
    <p>contents are in html</p>
    <h2>head</h2>
    <p>container of information NOT displayed on the page</p>
    <h3>Title</h3>
    <p>this always lives in the head. Necessary for valid HTML5 page.</p>
