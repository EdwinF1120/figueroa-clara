  <h2 class="heading">The hobbit</h2>
  <p>J. R. R. Tolkien's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit" target="_blank">The hobbit</a> was a masterful journey through an imaginatively realized world, filled with its own history, species, and politics. While a light-hearted tale by its cover, The hobbit fills the reader with inspiration for even the <em>little man</em> to play a role in <strong>big events</strong>. Tolkien reminds us that, while adventure has its own transformative draws, one will always rightly long for the simple comforts in life.</p>
